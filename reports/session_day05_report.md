### Session Report – EX-01

**Coverage:**
- My Info module:
  - Personal Details
  - Contact Details
  - Emergency Contacts
  - Qualifications

**Issues Found:**
- Calendar scrolls the page unexpectedly when selecting year
- DOB accepts future dates
- Save button lacks hover state
- Forms accept invalid inputs (e.g., letters in numeric fields, invalid emails)
- Save action triggered even with empty fields

**Questions / Next Ideas:**
- Should “Nationality” and “Marital Status” be required?
- What are the expected validations for telephone and email fields?
- What happens when uploading invalid file types in attachments?
