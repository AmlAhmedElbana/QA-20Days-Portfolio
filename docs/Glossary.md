## Chapter 1 ‚Äì Fundamentals of Testing

- **Testing**: Process of evaluating software to find defects and ensure it meets requirements.  
- **Defect**: A flaw or deviation in a software product.  
- **Error (Mistake)**: A human action that produces an incorrect result.  
- **Failure**: A deviation of the software from its expected behavior.  
- **Debugging**: Process of finding, analyzing and fixing the cause of failures.  
- **Verification**: Are we building the product right? (e.g. reviews, static testing)  
- **Validation**: Are we building the right product? (e.g. execution-based testing)  
- **Quality**: The degree to which a component meets specified requirements and expectations.  
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Planned activities to ensure quality (process-focused).  
- **Quality Control (QC)**: Identifying defects in the actual product (product-focused).  
- **Exhaustive Testing**: Testing all possible combinations (often impractical).  
- **Risk**: The possibility of an event that could impact objectives.

## Chapter 2 ‚Äì Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Testing

- **SDLC**: Structured process followed for developing software (e.g. Waterfall, Agile).  
- **Test Levels**: Unit ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí System ‚Üí Acceptance.  
- **Test Types**: Functional, Non-functional, Structural, and Change-related testing.  
- **Regression Testing**: Testing unchanged parts after changes to ensure nothing broke.  
- **Confirmation Testing**: Re-testing a specific failed test after a fix.  
- **White-box Testing**: Based on internal code structure (e.g. unit testing).  
- **Black-box Testing**: Based on external behavior and specifications.  
- **Component Testing**: Testing individual units in isolation.  
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interaction between integrated components.  
- **System Testing**: End-to-end validation of the whole system.  
- **Acceptance Testing**: Performed to validate system readiness by user/stakeholder.

## Chapter 3 ‚Äì Static Testing

- **Static Testing**: Testing technique without executing the code (e.g. reviews, walkthroughs).  
- **Review**: Evaluation of documentation/code to find defects early.  
- **Walkthrough**: Informal review led by the author.  
- **Technical Review**: Formal review by technical peers.  
- **Inspection**: Formal, structured review to detect defects systematically.  
- **Defect Density**: Number of defects per size unit (e.g. per 1,000 lines of code).  
- **Static Analysis**: Automated examination of code or design without executing it.  
- **Tool-Supported Review**: Using tools to manage or automate the review process.

## Chapter 4 ‚Äì Test Analysis and Design
### üß© Decision Table & State Transition Terms

- **Condition**:  
  A specific input, state, or scenario that affects the outcome of a decision.  
  Example: "Is the user logged in?" (Yes/No)

- **Rule**:  
  A unique combination of conditions that defines a single path in a decision table.  
  Each rule leads to a specific outcome (action).  
  Example: Rule 3 = Logged in: Yes, Cart: Yes, Payment: No

- **Action**:  
  The system's response or output triggered by a specific rule.  
  Example: ‚ÄúAllow Checkout‚Äù or ‚ÄúDisplay Error: Missing Payment Info‚Äù

- **Event**:  
  An occurrence that causes a change in the system state.  
  Often represents a user action.  
  Example: Clicking "Add to Cart", "Finish", or "Cancel"

- **Transition**:  
  The movement from one state to another triggered by an event.  
  Example: From [Checkout Info] to [Overview] after clicking "Continue"
