## Chapter 1 – Fundamentals of Testing

- **Testing**: Process of evaluating software to find defects and ensure it meets requirements.  
- **Defect**: A flaw or deviation in a software product.  
- **Error (Mistake)**: A human action that produces an incorrect result.  
- **Failure**: A deviation of the software from its expected behavior.  
- **Debugging**: Process of finding, analyzing and fixing the cause of failures.  
- **Verification**: Are we building the product right? (e.g. reviews, static testing)  
- **Validation**: Are we building the right product? (e.g. execution-based testing)  
- **Quality**: The degree to which a component meets specified requirements and expectations.  
- **Quality Assurance (QA)**: Planned activities to ensure quality (process-focused).  
- **Quality Control (QC)**: Identifying defects in the actual product (product-focused).  
- **Exhaustive Testing**: Testing all possible combinations (often impractical).  
- **Risk**: The possibility of an event that could impact objectives.

## Chapter 2 – Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Testing

- **SDLC**: Structured process followed for developing software (e.g. Waterfall, Agile).  
- **Test Levels**: Unit → Integration → System → Acceptance.  
- **Test Types**: Functional, Non-functional, Structural, and Change-related testing.  
- **Regression Testing**: Testing unchanged parts after changes to ensure nothing broke.  
- **Confirmation Testing**: Re-testing a specific failed test after a fix.  
- **White-box Testing**: Based on internal code structure (e.g. unit testing).  
- **Black-box Testing**: Based on external behavior and specifications.  
- **Component Testing**: Testing individual units in isolation.  
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interaction between integrated components.  
- **System Testing**: End-to-end validation of the whole system.  
- **Acceptance Testing**: Performed to validate system readiness by user/stakeholder.

## Chapter 3 – Static Testing

- **Static Testing**: Testing technique without executing the code (e.g. reviews, walkthroughs).  
- **Review**: Evaluation of documentation/code to find defects early.  
- **Walkthrough**: Informal review led by the author.  
- **Technical Review**: Formal review by technical peers.  
- **Inspection**: Formal, structured review to detect defects systematically.  
- **Defect Density**: Number of defects per size unit (e.g. per 1,000 lines of code).  
- **Static Analysis**: Automated examination of code or design without executing it.  
- **Tool-Supported Review**: Using tools to manage or automate the review process.
