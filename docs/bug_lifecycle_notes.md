# 🐞 Bug Life-Cycle – Quick Summary

## 1. What is the Bug Life-Cycle?

The bug life-cycle describes the journey of a defect from discovery to closure.  
It helps teams manage, track, and resolve issues efficiently.

### 🔁 Common States:
- **New** → Bug reported
- **Assigned** → Given to a developer
- **Open** → Under investigation/fix
- **Fixed** → Developer claims it is solved
- **Retest** → QA verifies the fix
- **Reopen** → Bug still exists
- **Closed** → Bug confirmed fixed
- **Deferred** → Fix is postponed

## 2. Priority vs Severity

| Term       | Who decides?         | Meaning                          | Example                              |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Severity** | Tester / QA          | How much the bug affects the system | Login failure = High Severity       |
| **Priority** | Project manager / Business | How fast the bug should be fixed | Logo typo = High Priority, Low Severity |

## 3. Notes

- Most bugs follow a 6–8 step cycle depending on team setup.
- Important to separate *business urgency* (Priority) from *technical impact* (Severity).
